What are you going to do with all those batteries when they go bad in 20 years? Whats going to burn to melt the steel to forge the frames of these cars? The list goes on amd on.",1
When he spoke about the need for transition between gas to electric cars he looked deeply saddened. He truly is doing this out of passion and almost a fear.,0

"Can't believe Elon Musk saying that the whole universe will eventually dissipate, the theory he's talking about would probably happen in more than  twenty billion years from now and the theory also claims that the total dissipation of the universe will happen in many trillion years in the future, being so unimaginative about the future can be expected from an uneducated person but when Musk comes up with such limited imagination it makes me think that he's probably not as bright as I thought .",1
Does Elon musk have an accent or I'm I just tripping ?,0
"You can always see his brain deeply thinking about everything he ever says, most people dont or cant do this if anyone knows what I mean its sort of autstic type but not quite, hes able to socialize but the way he thinks about everything is different.

"He takes his time NOT because he is thinking about his answer but because he is selecting and reading his answers...notice he will look to his bottom right, then direct eye contact to his bottom left, then he seems to be reading something in the bottom center and it must‚Äôve not made sense to him notice how theres a long silence but no one has caught this ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è pls watch his other interviews aswell, i honestly believe that musk already has neuralink for quite sometime implanted and will one day make a reveal and announce that it works because ...he placed one inside his brain 20yrs ago.....HE IS READING GUYS !!!!!!! his answers are not answered right away because he has to read them first but they are calculated answers! WATCH!",0

"Very  very basic AI recently was able to make thousands of lethal compounds just by switching a very simple part of the code meant to find potential lethal combinations and stop them. The data used is public. The program written to find it was basic. Many of them substantially more lethal than what we knew of before this ""test"". When he says its too late, he means it. If this is what we know of from headlines, its 10x to 100x worse behind closed doors.",1
