"Elon is generally sketched out about AI in the near future. He got super spooked out in that topic and almost seemed like he was, in his own way,  begging for the stop of AI.",1
"""Why am I dragging this dead horse around? and I'M a horse... I don't like it""",1
Joe good job! You‚Äôre 2 different people yet you found a way to do a great interview. I had to watch in like 5 parts because I really wanted to hear and focus on everything Musk said üëå,0
Jorge Sampaoli has a podcast? haha its so similar with him kkkkkkk,0
Elon is here for a reason,0
Read the ingredients in mandates,0
You can tell that Elon‚Äôs intellect haunts him.,1
its way too much scary moment.. look at Elon' s eyes and  listen after 20:17 üò∂,1
I don't think Joe understood how impressive it was to get working sun tiles that doesn't show the cells inside when the sun reflects off it. Elon was so passionate about it lol,0
I want a Tesla now... fuck,1
Crazy how joe predicts the metaverse.,0
We talkin‚Äô ‚Äòbout ai bit none of y‚Äôall talking about corporate made super heroes like vought in The Boys,0

"Elon, why you bet for Space X, if you believe so hard on AI?",0
I'm convinced  Elon musk  is really a future human . Or alien,0
Love how elon didnt inhale the weed lmao,0
"Joe‚Ä¶ your not listening when he explained this is likely a simulation and seems very real. Your in the simulation now‚Ä¶ not in the future, now. Wow when Elon starts speaking about pulling carbon out of the earth and polluting the atmosphere he‚Äôs speaking like he‚Äôs come from a place where he‚Äôs seen the devastation, I think he‚Äôs actually crying, he‚Äôs just holding back the eyes from dripping tears but he‚Äôs got so much emotion on this. üòÆ",0
"(Paraphrasing)""I'm so concerned about if I'm in a simulation or not""""Wanna check out my samurai sword? It's from the 1500s""""Oh really?""""Yeah, lemme grab it""",0
I love Elon Musk. Motherfucker is really an alien but I‚Äôm cool with that.,0

The Ben Franklin of our time. Elon not Joe.,0
Can we get another Elon episode please!!!!!,0
Joe is no dummy by any means! That fact the can ask Elon questions and he actually has to think about them says a lot about Joe!,0
Elon‚Äôs boring tunnels would be a good bunker for homes,0
@Stewie Griffin. You hit the nail on the head. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm hearing. It makes sense.,0
Elon's special shirt ^Wears it during important events,0
2:32:00 Elon musk broke robot character for one second,1
"His management of articulating rhetorical statements and answers,impeccable, a hands on Einstein",0

Elons so smart his brains ao ful theres zero room for emotions lmao,0
Elon seems to be about improving the way we do things. Love to see what he could do to re-engineer big pharma  I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs thinking about med-beds -sound and light tech,0
I feel like he‚Äôs picking his words so carefully because he knows that if we knew what he knew we would all freak the fuck out but we still just keep going down the same path. It‚Äôs like the path of least resistance until there is no going back. I think he‚Äôs right when he says it could be ok or it could be terrible! I hope I‚Äôm not here to see it!,1
plot twist: elon scared AI will break his simulation,1
"Joe needs to have Elon,Brian Cox,and Neil Degrasse Tyson in one podcast ü§Ø",0
please help me I do not wish to be homeless either,1
"I've never seen Joe so freaked out about anything more than the possibility that this moment now could be a simulation and not reality at all. He interrupted Elon's explanation as he began to argue the facts on why it actually Could be because Joe just couldn't handle it.  He drove it home again a second time during an unrelated topic.  There's very real fear being displayed here and all I could think of as a reason why is that he didn't want it to encroach his brain, not even one bit because if it did it would fuck up and infiltrate every psychedelic trip he'd try to have and enjoy from that moment forward.  It reminded me of fighting off panic attacks successfully for all those years until one incident just sent it all crashing down upon me with the weight of hell itself- except I thought I was having an acid flashback because I knew nothing about them. Either way, I recognized immediately what Joe is trying to do-but the problem is that for someone to feel the need to put up such a fight  the have acknowledged the issue and it's already too late. It's just a matter of time now...",1
He creepy,1
' so who do you go to about that'? I dont know what you mean. Well you need to ask someone when your digging fucking holes everywhere hahahaha,1
I think Elon Musk is depressed.,1
I got distracted thinking about a a space travel song. That‚Äôs how pro evolution humans are.,0

I get creepy Matrix futureflashbacks when I see this. It doesnt feel good. Lets learn to control our natural consciousness before we mess with it with machines....,1
Musk doesn't strike me as ultra intelligent.....at all. Christian Von koennigsegg.......is a far better listen,1
"Ted Kaczynski aka unabomber : ""203. Imagine an alcoholic sitting with a barrel of wine in front of him. Suppose he starts saying to himself, ‚ÄúWine isn‚Äôt bad for you if used in moderation. Why, they say small amounts of wine are even good for you! It won‚Äôt do me any harm if I take just one little drink.... ‚Äú Well you know what is going to happen. Never forget that the human race with technology is just like an alcoholic with a barrel of wine."" The Unabomber Trial: The Manifesto",1
Hey guys,0
did he send an android instead of himself?,0
Elon is international. In Russia we even have memes with him xD,0
Joe Rogan's Neil deGrasse Tyson voice is ON. POINT.,0
"Problem here is the speed of regulation which is slow by law, i know this is far beyond but the problem.. but if you produce Artificial Intelligence and sound the alarm of the pro's and con's uses and gradual uses of our demise it can lead to unity of continents, for example - Here in the European Union we can be assertive with regulation and use it's power to regulate the technology sector with a joint agreement with the member states at their discretion (i.e. EU Summits). Member states can argue what is the ethical reasoning behind Ai and value and respective value, such as what can it do in terms of Policing and General romance structure with/for public, EU regulation can and policy directives can be made in a year but the amendment of the EU Law can take a year prior to the consequence of AI or new information from it's research and general public opinion.",1
30 million views geeesh!,0
"I am definitely a person who is fighting tooth and nail to not end up in a simulation. I only carry revolvers, I love old muscle cars from the 60's and 70's, I watch mostly black and white television and movies and the color ones are from before 1980. I only listen to music from back in the day, mostly pre 80's music, but nothing after 1996. I wish so badly that I could go back to the 50's and love out the rest of my days on yesteryear.",1
love Elon a true inspiration to us entrepreneurs,0
What if we already devoloped all these things long ago but the genius left and people who couldn't recreate there technology stayed here and civilization relapsed üò≤,0
Please subtitle this to spanish. I have so many people to share it with.,0
You can do anything when you have money‚Ä¶just for fun he made 10 million lol,0
Anyone who takes a liking or interest in this you should drop what you are doing and  get knee deep in the works of Elon Musk and South Africa ... This is the now and we have power within the now The people who are for-running will be reserving power for themselves naturally,1
Elon musk is a weird smart but weird fkin dude,1
4:54 the most deadliest stare,1

20:35 2:10:00,0

The thing i love about JRE is he has some really legitimate genius guests but the podcast isn't just a wankfest that goes over the audience head. Like it's digestible by your normal person,0
knew this would be the most viewed podcast for joe,0
Is saying flame thrower,0
"Now here is a man muzzled, god damn this guy wants to tell us what‚Äôs coming but for some reason unbeknown to us he can‚Äôt, I‚Äôve been on the edge of my seat this whole interview. WTF are we heading into....covid, lockdowns, mass vaccination, 5g etc etc etc the one thing I‚Äôm sure of is this world is about change into something entirely different.",1
"Ive never watched a Youtube video this long, props to you, your team and Elon. Very informative",0
"Two dudes hanging out, drinking, smoking and discussing what others won't. Its like sitting in the room and chilling with them discussing the mysterious Universe. I love it.",0

To me Rogan is the best bridge between intellectual and everyman who's podding the cast these days.,0
"Idk who's dumber, Elon or the people who think he's smart",1
He seems constantly out of breath,1
He sounds like the Jeff goldblum in the movie the fly lol 1986 film,0
I a ‚Äúnormal person?‚Äù Think it would be cool to have them both as friends. Never happen I know. I very much like the longer they talk and sip the more he begins to open up.,0
Elon: go live in the simulation Joe: yeahElon: in the simulation,0
be more nice hell yeah!!,0
I don't know if everyone is aware of this but in Australia we already have underground tunnels used for traffic control and I'm pretty sure they are all over europe too and have existed for years.,0
I think elon has found a way to not sleep and he is just awake 24 hours a day,0
Joe: magnet roads?Elon: no. no. no? No. No.,0
watching the latest Orville episode has mad this ten times more terrifying...,1
"I have never taken any notice of Musk so i am not sure when to draw the line between what is a joke and what is serious, so it does strike me as a little disturbing when, in the first 3 minutes he is talking about people buying the the flame thrower sold by his company and says "" there's nothing i could do to stop them"" . So he is either joking, stupid or really detached from what he has control over. Strangely i have always had a bit of a dislike of the guy for absolutely no reason at all, just some sort of weird prejudice that i don't know the origin of... Hopefully i can watch the rest of the podcast with an open mind..",1
can we create an artificial afterlife so that we can be guaranteed to live on the internet after our physical form dies,0
