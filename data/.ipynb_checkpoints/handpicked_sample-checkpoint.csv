Why is it that @ 1:10 elon musk started twitching like he was a malfunctioning robot?!
"@ 2:33:20 Joe pretty much predicted him being targeted because of what he ""said"" on his podcast.... I love this guy, genuine and straightforward. Elon is amazing, I learned so much about this guy."
"Elon is the real world, Borg, right in front of us. ""Resistance is futile"""
Chicks on dating sites almost never look like they do in person. Filters should be banned.
i love joe Rogan but I would slap the shit out of him at the end of the interview because he was just asking dumb ass questions Joe Rogan stop asking questions to a genius
Joe! I love you but wtf is that on your left eye? You and I are the same age and I have skin tags all over me and no funds to take them off! No disrespect my Friend!
Elon musks mannerisms remind me a lot of myself. The way he pauses and thinks before each sentence.I have pretty severe ADHD. And I have a theory about him ü§î
If I'm given the opportunity to have a fully fledged artificial body I'm going to do it
"I love how Elon just says there really isn‚Äôt much thought to these ideas, they‚Äôre just simple."
Surely Joe Rogan remembers Alex Jones warning him about some of this stuff‚Ä¶
He very well may be a ai implanted by the government..if he becomes president ill be proven atleast to being halfway correct on what I think I know hope jre is still a thing so I can explain more on this. And how are yall not linking how he's talking about cars and Bob lazars life. Dude even explained Bob saying his hands was like two likepoles of magnets üß≤ üò≥
"The Matrix is just a replacement for God, but it's not a religion. It's an untestable theory, don't waste time with it."
Elons voice should be in the TESLA haha
I love watching Elon in interviews. He makes my mind explode and think about new things. He also urges me to want to have more fun.
"Joe Rogan, u are totally holding ur own with Elon musk! Love it!"
If we could turn back time to the good old days where the momma‚Äôs sang us to sleep but now we‚Äôre stressed out
OK tell me how quarters all alleviates testosterone and a body to regulate it but if you eat too much food with quarters all in it that he and I actually make you make fat you make fat brain function and actually and actually an unhealthy heart and all organs but you wanna go on a diet so if you're so f**** smart tell me
"millions of elons or joes? that's not how nature works. nature produces masses of life, but only a few of them are outstanding ""mutants"" who drive biological or technological evolution. our biological evolution came to a halt thousands of years ago. technological evolution is currently the only way to advance the human race."
Interesting
Casio wave ceptor mtg900 g shock will be the last watch you ever own! Solar powered Neve needed a battery going on 18 years strong! Go get one!!!!
For a while it felt like I was watching a replicant fail the Voight-Kampff test.
I love him bring him back please
The man who took the credit for other people's hard work and inventions
So intelligent that he has to think about how to say things so that normal people can understand him...
He is truly an alien wtf
I follow my spirit/source what I'm passionate and want to do. Found some OCCULT PROBLEMS original creator culture! Alien to lolüòÇ GOLF.  BENTLEY GOLF BESPOKEN!
I love what Elon said at the end.
Someone tell elon for me THAT HES MY FRIEND THATS MY DAWG
May Lermission bbe askedfor my friend an I rreunion
his time management is he pays everyone else to think and work for him dumbass.... you think musk invented all this shitit . hahaha
"This is such a though provoking interview, it provides so much insight in terms of Elon's thinking. Joe you are great interviewer, this is the second one of your interviews I've watched recently. Keep up the great work buddy."
EM only impresses you simple minded folks..nothing he says is extraordinary..his accent helps his disguise
It's fascinating to listening to Elon musk talk
i like it
"I so love hearing Joe and Elon talk together, very fun ideas,  great comments and interesting visions.  I like these two men from what I see from here."
Injoying the show  i like being able to see you makes it seem like i am there radio would not b the same.
I had dreams baby that came true four bay
"There's a movie, which is predicated on AI computer taking control. Colossus: The Forbin Project - Synopsis - After being handed full control, Colossus' draconian logic expands on its original nuclear defense directives to assume total control of the world and end all warfare for the good of mankind despite its creators' orders to stop"
"Amidst the cosmic vastness, a man of industry and visionElon Musk, a titan of technology and innovation."
"Am I the only one who thinks elon musk is a savvy scam artist and this entire podcast is just inflating his ego for his half baked projects? Now just a few years later he buys sham twitter in his over inflated confidence as a money pit funded by his over inflated stock, lol"
I said about the heat mite kill the air and the ship will go up faster so down same he mite got my id.we will see.the church steeled my id.
but pessimistic - is more often reality .  we need to face reality
That's crazy if time travel is real the best object to send back wouldn't be a human who could make errors but an AI who is smart enough not to make any.
Look closer you can see he loves cruel and now we know because he loves Amber Herd.   This guy always scared TF outta me.  Yuk.
Somehow i find this interview a bit weird
Elon  seems to find humor in leading folks imagination and just watching them freak out.
"Lol. Elon just told us all the matrix is real deal. Better start believing Neo cause this shit has already hit the fan ü§£ imagine a female humanoid that could seduce you and slip a VR headset on in your sleep then your black bagged and getting a needle through the back of your dome üò© welcome to avatar. Wonder if we‚Äôll be blue ?Edit : Elon - ‚Äú we should take action to make the future better ‚Äú Essentially saying we already know the AI will take over and cloak us. So why not embrace it before it‚Äôs a war that exterminates us, right ??? Someone cool me off man I‚Äôm going down the hole deep."
"How much do people even actually think about chimps????Joe:  ALL THE TIME ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£Literally ME, all the great apes are FASCINATING"
His demeanor is somehow odd for me!
Joe Rogan is probably my favorite human being on the whole entire planet!!! I love him soooo much I‚Äôm obsessed with these podcasts! They are on 24/7 in my house
Yeah but will you really know the answer or just repeat what your accessing.....
How about a alternator on the car it charges while you drive
The discussion of AI scared the ever living shit out of me. I pray that God will intervene!!
Elon is a person WHO PUT THE WORK IN THAT IS WHY HE IS SUCCESSFUL
Incredible guy. He definitely deserves the awe for achievements.Wonder what the future holds?
Elon has aged horribly in the last 3 years
sounds like he i selling the matrix
2048 ill bck to watch the comments again
"He‚Äôs doing it because he‚Äôs wired this way ‚Ä¶.. and your not . Thats why your baffled by his time management. I watched the whole pocast and it was a good interview , thanks for your hard work."
crazy
This was a great video to watch today :)
I love you but he kinda makes u look like a school girl
"Okay love from the past 3 years I first started with the piece of evidence was the 50,000-year-old message Leo's Ascension message to Leo and the way I'm going to change Entertainment System the entertainment platform which I have then I went to the where the debate and then from the weather today please from music and then from rapping to all the way down to judging all the house at the center then from the house of the center and all the way through it's been one hell of a ride"
Why you say that cause you‚Äôre a man but women like to gossip at the same time sometimes I think men gossip even more than women and women gossip a lot and I‚Äôm a woman I know y‚Äôall call us cackling hens but the fact is men gossip sometimes even more than women so I guess if you‚Äôre gonna be on social media gotta be willing to take the punches but when they death threats and people around your house it‚Äôs more of a cry out for help with social media
When God say let's create man in our image that was a simulation.  The substrate creating the simulations in my opinion would have to be some kind of intelligent create with the ability to cause things to become.  For the agnostic and atheist or just simply uber scientist that's problematic because there has to be a creator for even the creator or that entity simply exist.   My only counter that to that is if you believe in no intelligent creator than we basically simply just exist just as a God figure can't simply exist.  Just my thoughts..
We have enough threats as the human race including each other - why would we try to actively create something faster stronger and more efficient than us.  Why don‚Äôt we spend any energy trying to understand ourselves
"‚ÄúGamea will be indistinguishable from reality, or civilization will end‚Äù‚Äîseems to be the cross road where are at already. Many mass shootings by young men I believe where likely at that point‚Ä¶and this stream of destruction can be the end eventually if we weaponize AI against each other."
"Wrong Elon! The more carbon dioxide we release in the atmosphere, the more plants grow and produce oxygen, which is what we need more of to be healthy and survive. Simple and true."
This is my 3rd time or so watching this.  This guy scares the heck outta me.  I really believe he is an alien.  Look at his body language.  It looks like he memics and states this true about A.I. and aliens.  Who would know better than them. Wow
FaithRedemption Trust in God in JesusHe created and made EVERYTHING
"FFS JOE...its a pit, a pit...a big pit, a hole in the ground...a pit lol"
The pause that Elon takes while speaking is weird and annoying.
"Yo Joe, you clown! How did Elon's grandpa get hung? Frederick Haldimann?? He's a complete idiot"
So why did tesla use its own tesla plug in america üá∫üá∏ and not allow other EV s to use his charging hubs.  Euro teslas where built right and have CCS .  Damage is already done reason everyone hates tesla. Euros and american EV drivers all hate teslas and will never buy one.  We would way rather have the Porsche EV that is quality and fast any day over a ugly tesla that looks like a wannabe mercedes fast but NO qualityThe tesla roadster is the only one that looks good but you never see them only all the ugly ones.üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©
"These tunnels explain how the world has ended before. If a civilization like Atlantis existed, just imagine how much they took from the earth to even advance into little tribes then big tribes then ships early map making and industrialization to what we have now, will everything eventually engulf itself? How do you pull diamonds concrete dirt water and move it places and expect it to implode after thousands of years. Ant colonies cease to  exist eventually, and everything is capable of being returned to the essence of dust, anything we‚Äôve invented nature can outdo as a destroyer or creator. Just look at the intricate bug system alone, we can build little flying drones but bugs were that before a robot became a bug and are self sufficient. Idk if what I‚Äôm saying is even fathomable"
This is really intersting deep shit yo
how can u tell this guy is worth a single penny lmao
"Bro I'd just be sooo tuned out if i wz high chillin in Joes podcast room. Shyt loook sooo lax fr. Also Rockstar should ask Rogan if he want to put some of his ""podcasts"" on they radio, shyt would b soo live"
"Ahh I finally get why he wanted to creat a committee for AI oversight, because he would be on that committee and be able to see where everyone in the industry is at and how they are working through AI, sneaky bastard"
"I think Mr. Musk is possibly on the autism spectrum. That isn't a negative judgement statement, it is simply an observation."
Im sorry but Elon makes Joe seem so dumb .. and He just lets him talk lol
By the end Joe was being such an embarrassing idiot I had to stop watching. Everything after about the 2 hour mark was cringy
He really doesn't want to answer the time management question lol.
He's so awkward lol
Look deep into Elon eyes‚Ä¶ I think I‚Äôm trippin but does his eyes look like snake eyes
"Elon rules Lmao, flame throwers, wish I had one"
04:53 so awkward
"When he is thinking of an answer, just watch him. You can almost see the gears in his head grinding. The 10 second pauses are insane. This guy HAS to be an alien."
Him and Amber turd speak the same way! WEIRD AF
Eye I browse are  Hysterical !!@ for real!
"Elon, why you bet for Space X, if you believe so hard on AI?"
Lol I guess pushing Elon musk to say what you wanna hear is funny..Actually his team is not been questioning at this interview...lol
This fucking cat sitting behind the screen  (ELon)is something tho.the most amazing  comp. ENG .
"""stupidity squared"""
"Im so weak. Whenever dead silence happens in a conversation I have to fill it with noise. I am so bad at awkwardness but the older I get the more I think it's actually has nothing to do with awkwardness and is just maturity and slowing your mouth down and allowing for digestion and thinking through your thoughts before putting them into words. Im just so awful at this and wish I had the confidence to do that more in conversations. I talk fast and loud and I always feel like I need to have laughable moments too often where I say something like quick one offs or one liners and laugh after. I always feel pressure to take on a role of making sure the person im talking to doesnt take on any stress or awkwardness or having to worry about leading the conversation. Sometimes it's hard though to always try to lead a conversation especially when the person seems they arent gonna take any initiative to themselves cuz I usually feel people out at first and see if they will lead the conversation but as soon as they leave it hanging I have to pick it up and lead it. Idk I think I have social issues but I certainly cover it up in the moment and try to play it cool but often feel releived when encounters with people are over.  I think im crazy, wtf did I just say!? I even type before thinking and just let it rip. I need to work on this cuz I feel like I just typed a bunch of nothing. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Don't you think Kim Jung is doing awesome controlling their country North Korea in back same old days without internet without technology's  there is no way AI can take over North korea
"Lowkey Elon is evil, the world will see after mars"
Most boring thing I've ever seen in my life and I love Joe Rogan
its still hilarious that the episode number  is #1169 ‚Ä¶. lol 69 üòé
Yes people could spend a lot less time on social media I agree this is my only way of communicating I don‚Äôt have jets and airplanes and even one cola I don‚Äôt even have a car lol are you stuck with Trump and Conor McGregor and George Peterson Peterson Jordan Peterson
