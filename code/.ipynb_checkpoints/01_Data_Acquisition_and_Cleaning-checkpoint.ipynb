    "Public image refers to the 'the character or attitudes that most people think' a person or organisation has ([source](https://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/public-image)). In most cases, a good public image is essential in:\n",
    "1. Building trust, \n",
    "2. Attracting customers, and \n",
    "3. Fostering positive relationships with stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, it is important for individuals and organisations to keep their finger on the pulse when it comes to understanding public sentiment around them at all times. In this project, I am going to focus on the public sentiment of a well-known and polarising figure the past few years, Elon Musk. In this scenario, I am part of a data science-backed PR agency to help Elon navigate the murky waters of media scrutiny and public perception, ensuring his actions and communications align with his goals.\n",

    "**<center>Can we create an effective classification model to identify the level of negative sentiment in text comments?</center>**\n",
    "\n",
    "The ideal outcome / goal is to help individuals and companies with understanding public sentiment around them in order to build their PR strategy. This will be done by creating a sentiment analysis model, with the dependent variable being a classifier whether a comment made about them is negative or not (where '1' refers to a negative comment and '0' refers to a non-negative comment).\n",
    "\n",
    "Success of the model will be determined by the recall and accuracy scores of the model. The higher the recall and accuracy scores, the better it is at predicting the public sentiment around an individual or company. Between the two, we will prioritise the recall score in order to minimise missing negative sentiments as much as possible. This is so that we have more data to look through if we want to dive deeper into understanding the reasons behind negative sentiments.\n",

    "The primary audience will be individuals and companies of interest, while the secondary audience will be  existing PR companies that we can explore partnerships with."
